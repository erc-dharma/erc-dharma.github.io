## Unclear and unknown symbols

when a symbol is definitely present, but it is so damaged (or unclear in your surrogate for a reason other than damage) that it cannot be assigned to any of the primary categories, use “indistinct” as a genus token, e.g. <g type="indistinct"/>
when a symbol can be assigned to one of the primary categories but due to damage (or any kind of unclarity in your surrogate) it cannot be identified more precisely, do either of the following:
simply classify it using the applicable genus token on its own, e.g. <g type="spiral"/>
add “indistinct” as a species to the genus token, e.g. <g type="circleIndistinct"/>
this latter method is recommended if your impression is that the symbol is not a typical representative of the genus
when you are working from a previous edition without any visual aid, and the previous editor(s) only report the presence of a symbol at a certain point but do not describe it (or describe it insufficiently), then, analogously to the above case, use whichever of the following options best suits your case:
use <g type="unknown"/> to encode a symbol that you cannot assign to a genus
use a genus without a species (e.g. <g type="spiral"/>) if you can assign a symbol to a genus but have no further information
use a genus with the species “unknown” (e.g. <g type="circleUnknown"/>) if your impression is that the symbol is not a typical representative of the genus
